# Update Notes — Release v1.2.6

- Corrected `engine-shim.ts` export:
  * SimEngine is now a class, not a const.
  * Fixes TS2749 compilation error when used as a type in `App.tsx`.
- Functionally identical to v1.2.5, just build-clean.

- Restored from v1.2.6 baseline
- Rolled forward build/dev script fixes
